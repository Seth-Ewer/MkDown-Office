## Introduction

The [Introduction](#introduction) section should summarize the motivations for creating the software, the need(s) addressed by the software, what the software does, and optionally, links to resources that can help orient readers. Ideally, this section should be short and use plain language. Keep in mind that not all readers will be familiar with the topic area.

## Installation

how to install the application

## Quick start

Nobody wants to read long explanations about how to use your software before they can try it, especially while they are still deciding _whether_ to try it. A [Quick start](#quick-start) section right after the installation instructions can help readers figure out what's involved.

## Usage

The [Usage](#usage) section would explain in more detail how to run the software, what kind of output or behavior to expect, and so on. It would cover basic operations as well as more advanced uses.

### Basic operation

When learning how to use anything but the simplest software, new users may appreciate beginning with basic features and modes of operation.

### More options

Some projects need to communicate additional information to users and can benefit from additional sections in the README file. It's difficult to give specific instructions here â€“ a lot depends on your software, your intended audience, etc. Use your judgment and ask for feedback from users or colleagues to help figure out what else is worth explaining.

## Known issues and limitations

In this section, summarize any notable issues and/or limitations of your software.

## Getting help

Inform readers how they can contact you, or at least how they can report problems they may encounter. This could take the form of a request to use the issue tracker on your repository. Some projects have associated discussion forums or mailing lists, and this section is a good place to mention those.

## Contributing

If your project accepts open-source contributions, this is where you can welcome contributions and explain to readers how they can go about it. Mention the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file in your repository, if you have one.

## License

This section should state any copyright asserted on the project materials as well as the terms of use for the software, files and other materials found in the project repository.

## Acknowledgments

This final section is where you should acknowledge funding and/or institutional support, prior work that influenced or inspired your project, resources that you used (such as other people's software), important contributions from other people, and anything else that deserves mention. After all, nothing is truly done in isolation; everything is built on top of something, and we all owe debts to other projects and people who helped us, supported us, and influenced us.

## 10 things we should NOT do

1. Make a good readme
2. Include tests, specs, features, and examples

4. Use good visual design for the project, product, and documentation
5. Get a domain name for the application
6. Make our license very clear and easy to find
7. Use GitHub to collect and respond to user issues and feedback
